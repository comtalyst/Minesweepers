# Minesweepers
The technical objective of the project is to train the "Minesweeper" bots to correctly walk through the "good mines" and evade the "bad mines" presented on a 2D plane using Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks.<br>

Each agent (bot) will have a unique model of Neural Network which will decide its next movement based on nearest mines.<br>
These agents will also simulate genetic algorithms in order to select only high-fitness models to be passed to the next generation. (That's why we have multiple bots).<br>

This project is part of the Independent Study in Advanced Programming course at George School.<br>
Some parts of the codes were provided by the instructor, Travis.<br>

Note that the codes have been kept in the original form at the time of submission.
