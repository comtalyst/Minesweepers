# Minesweepers
The technical objective of the project is to train the "Minesweeper" bots to correctly walk through the "good mines" and evade the "bad mines" presented on a 2D plane using Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks.<br>

This project is part of the Independent Study in Advanced Programming course at George School.<br>

Note that the codes have been kept in the original form at the time of submission.
